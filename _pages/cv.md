Education
======
* Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), February 2020 -- March 2025

Research Experience
======
* Professor Tianyin Xu’s Lab, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (May 2025 -- Present)
  * Remote Research Intern advised by [Prof. Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/)
  * Developing a benchmark framework to systematically evaluate the ability of AI agents to detect, localize, and
mitigate realistic failures in cloud-native environments.
  * Engineered low-level fault injection modules using eBPF to simulate OS-level failures.
  * Implemented a suite of realistic Kubernetes application misconfigurations to expand the benchmark’s fault
library.
  * Overhauled the legacy Train-Ticket microservice benchmark by upgrading its Java runtime, dependencies, and
codebase to enable the integration of a modern, flag-based fault control mechanism.
  * Developed a CloudLab provisioner to enable push-button, multi-node deployment of the framework.

* Professor Anindya Iqbal’s Lab, BUET, Bangladesh (May 2025 -- Sep 2025)
  * Advised by [Prof. Anindya Iqbal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAuiNFgAAAAJ&hl=en)
  * Designed and developed a novel agentic framework that autonomously translates natural language test
specifications for web UIs into executable Playwright scripts.
  * Implemented the core translation algorithm that converts raw web agent interaction traces into structured,
executable Playwright test scripts.
  * Conducted evaluations against industry-standard tools comparing quality of test scripts.
  * Co-first authored a paper under review at **FSE 2026**.

* Human-Computer Interaction Research, BUET (July 2024 -- May 2025)
  * Advised by [Prof. Anindya Iqbal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAuiNFgAAAAJ&hl=en)
  * Developed NuevAI, a semi-autonomous system for creating Pedagogical Conversational Agents.
  * Designed and conducted the evaluation to assess the systems.
  * Second authored a paper accepted at the **16th Biannual CHItaly 2025**.

Work experience
======
* Software Engineer, Monsha.AI (July 2025 -- Present)
  * Building an AI-powered EdTech platform that creates teaching resources and materials for educators.
  * Developing agentic LLM workflows to address diverse educational needs and enabling the dynamic creation of resources
with quality assurance mechanisms.

* Software Engineer, Zelf AI (November 2024 -- June 2025)
  * Developed Instagram profile and content scraping systems with authentication bypass and TLS fingerprint spoofing
capabilities for large-scale data collection.
  * Implemented anti-bot detection countermeasures for Instagram scrapers including distributed token management with
LRU caching, unique device fingerprinting, and automated token validation systems.
  * Re-engineered the TikTok scraping infrastructure by replacing browser-based signed url generation with stand-alone
cryptographic signing method, significantly improving performance and reducing system complexity.
