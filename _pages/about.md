Hi, I'm Pial, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/) with a passion for AI, systems engineering, and competitive programming.

I'm a software engineer and researcher with interests spanning software engineering and systems reliability. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at Monsha.AI, where I'm building an AI-powered EdTech platform that creates teaching resources and materials for educators using agentic LLM workflows.

I'm a research intern at [Professor Tianyin Xu's](https://tianyin.github.io/) lab at UIUC, developing a benchmark framework for evaluating the ability of AI agents to detect, localize, and mitigate realistic failures in cloud-native environments. I'm also collaborating with [Professor Ashrafi's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lPz7L8kAAAAJ&hl=en) lab at Towson University on using LLMs to generalize logs from different sources. Previously, I worked with [Professor Anindya Iqbal's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAuiNFgAAAAJ&hl=en) lab at BUET on agentic frameworks for automated test generation and pedagogical conversational agents.

Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position for fall 2026.
