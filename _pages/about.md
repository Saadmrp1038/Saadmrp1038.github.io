Hi, I'm Pial. I recently graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), and I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer at Monsha.AI.

In my free time, I love doing research work. I'm currently a research intern at two labs: xlab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm advised by [Prof. Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/), and LUCID Lab at Towson University, working under [Prof. Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lPz7L8kAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests focus on the intersection of AI agents, systems, and software.

At xlab, I'm developing a benchmark framework to evaluate how AI agents handle realistic system failures. Meanwhile, at LUCID Lab, I'm working on using LLMs to generalize logs from different sources. I'm also actively working two other projects, generating UI test scripts from natural language test cases and developing conversational agents that help educators create pedagogically relevant slides.
